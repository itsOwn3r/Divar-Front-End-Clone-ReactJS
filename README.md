This is part of the 'Full-Stack Fully-Functional' Clone of Divar.ir (Link to that project will be found on my resume.)

The front end clone includes:
1. Full UI clone of divar.ir's mobile app.
2. Though it uses static dummy data, but Categories, Chat, Sending new ad(won't be saved ofc), Call button, and ... are all working.
3. My-account page is there, But since it's a front end version, Login will not work.
4. Sending new ad, shows a preview of images with a tiny X button to remove them.
5. Postchi(Divar's notification system).
6. Search.

Login and Sign Up (with OTP via SMS), Chat, Postchi, Sending new ad(Also removing) are only working on Fully-Functional version.
